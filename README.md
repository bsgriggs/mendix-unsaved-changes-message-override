Widget to show a message to the user when they have unsaved changes and try to leave a page.

## Features
- Show a customized message when the user clicks a navigation item
- Block the user closing the browser tab
- Customized caption for Discard and Cancel buttons
- Accepts a boolean expression for the most flexibility 

## Limitations
- Cannot detect the use of the browser back or forward buttons
- Cannot use the custom message content when the user closes the browser tab (no longer supported by browsers)
- Navigation items MUST use either Nanoflows or show the page directly
- Nanoflows that require a close page AND show page activity must combine the two activities by using the close page setting on the show page activity
